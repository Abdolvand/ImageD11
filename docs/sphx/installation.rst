Getting ImageD11
================

The easiest way is to download fable, which contains a python25
installation and ImageD11 inside 

If you want to modify the program, or write your own python scripts 
then you probably need a regular python module installation.

ImageD11 is dependent on the prior installation of several other packages. 
These are: 
Python itself (v2.5 or greater ideally)
The numpy numerical array package.
Matplotlib for plotting.
PyOpenGl (with the Togl widget). You might need Togl from [5] 
Finally, you need to download ImageD11 itself [6]
