" * closest.c  Two useful functions for indexing grains \n"\
" *\n"\
" * 1. From python: closest(cosines_allowed, cosine_measured)\n"\
" *    Take 1 peak with hkl's assigned, compute the cosines to\n"\
" *    another powder ring (angles between this peak and peaks in\n"\
" *    that ring). This extension finds the best peak in the\n"\
" *    other ring to pair up with.\n"\
" *\n"\
" *    More generally closest(array, values) finds the closest\n"\
" *    item in values to one of the values in array.  Returns the\n"\
" *    difference and the index of the closest thing it finds.\n"\
" *\n"\
" *    Both arguments should be one dimensional Numeric arrays\n"\
" *    of type Numeric.Float\n"\
" *\n"\
" * 2. From python: score(ubi, gv, tol) where ubi is an orientation\n"\
" *    matrix and gv are an array of g-vectors. Returns the number\n"\
" *    of g-vectors which have integer hkl peaks within tolerance\n"\
" *    tol. Uses the conv_double_to_int_fast function in here for \n"\
" *    factor of !EIGHT! speed increase compared to rounding in \n"\
" *    C. In fact this gives the nearest even integer, instead\n"\
" *    of the nearest integer, but we don't care, as a peak having\n"\
" *    hkl of 0.5 is nowhere near being indexed anyway.\n"\
" *\n"\
" *    Returns and integer - number of peaks indexed\n"\
" *    UBI is a 3x3 Numeric.Float array (figure out the transposing yourself)\n"\
" *    GV is a nx3 Numeric.Float array, and you should try to make the 3 \n"\
" *       be the fast index for best performance\n"\
" *       \n"\
" * 3. score_and_refine(ubi, gv, tol) \n"\
" *    From python: same as score, I hope, but ubi is overwritten\n"\
" *    with refined matrix following paciorek algorithm which is \n"\
" *    in indexing.py\n"\
" *    \n"\
" * \n"\
" * 4. score_and_assign( ubi, gv, tol, drlv, labels, (int) label)\n"\
" *    as for score, but assignments are only made if drlv is lower than\n"\
" *    the previous. Fills in label with the new label\n"\
" *\n"\
" * 5. refine_assigned( ubi, gv, labels, label, weight) \n"\
" *    Use only the peaks where label matches labels in refinement \n"\
" *    ...following again the Paciorek algorithm \n"\
" *\n"\
" * 6. put_incr( data, indices, values)\n"\
" *    pretty much as numeric.put but as increments\n"\
" *\n"\
" * 7. weighted_refine(ubi, gv, tol, weights) \n"\
" *    From python: same as score, but with weights, and ubi is overwritten\n"\
" *    with refined matrix following paciorek algorithm which is \n"\
" *    in indexing.py\n"\
" *    \n"\
