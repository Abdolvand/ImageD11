Setup script for python distutils package

Can be used to generate source and binary distributions

On windows (with mingw tools installed, from www.mingw.org:
    python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 sdist bdist bdist_wininst

In Linux
    python setup.py build sdist

Once assumed you have the "g77" compiler available for fortran and that
the usual (gnu linux/win32 x86) name mangling are done for the splines
extension to work ... now that code went through f2c, so it should just
work ??
